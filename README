ABOUT
=====

A Dialer for oFono using EFL (Enlightenment Foundation
Libraries) to be used with Tizen platform, and supports bluetooth HFP.


DEBUGGING

		toggles debug (level=4) of whole EFL

	EINA_LOG_LEVELS=dialer:4,messages:4
		toggles debug of dialer and messages logging domains.

	EINA_LOG_ABORT=1

	EINA_LOG_ABORT_LEVEL=2
		make it also abort on errors.

	EINA_LOG_BACKTRACE=2

CONTACT DATABASE FOR DESKTOP TESTING
====================================

For desktop we're providing a placeholder infrastructure for
contacts. It does not provide GUI to edit, but can show the basic
information and use it.

However a manual database must be created. To aid this task, a script
is provided in data/scripts/ofono-efl-contacts-db-create.py that can
be executed with a comma-separated-value (CSV) file as parameter. A
sample CSV is provided at data/examples/contacts.csv. Please excute
the following command from git checkout:

        ./data/scripts/ofono-efl-contacts-db-create.py \
                ./data/examples/contacts.csv
